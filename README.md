## Problem Statement
Clinical documentation is one of the biggest sources of burnout for healthcare professionals. Doctors spend a significant portion of their time manually writing SOAP notes, which reduces patient interaction, increases fatigue, and introduces inconsistencies in medical records.

## Solution
**MedFlow AI** is an AI-powered system that automatically generates structured, accurate, and readable **SOAP notes** from clinical input. It transforms raw patient data into professionally formatted medical documentation and exports it as a **clean, visually appealing PDF**, ready for sharing or record-keeping.

## Architecture & Flow

The system orchestrates specialized agents to process patient data securely and generate actionable insights.

## Key Features
- **Automated SOAP Note Generation**  
  Converts clinical inputs into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections.

- **Professional PDF Output**  
  Generates well-structured, readable, and print-ready PDFs suitable for real clinical workflows.

- **Consistency & Accuracy**  
  Ensures standardized medical documentation across patients and practitioners.

- **Time Saving**  
  Reduces documentation time, allowing doctors to focus more on patient care.

## How It Works
1. Clinical input is provided by the healthcare professional.  
2. AI processes and structures the data into a SOAP note format.  
3. The system generates a **beautifully formatted PDF** with clear headings, spacing, and typography.  
4. The PDF can be saved, shared, or integrated into existing medical systems.
